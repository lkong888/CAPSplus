# Introduction
These scripts are for CAPSplus data analysis. The following steps are included:
1. Data preprocessing: fastp, alignment, deduplicate
2. Methylation calling by asTair. Check conversion rate on spike in.
3. Remove blacklisted regions and known SNV. 
4. Downstream analysis: correlation, genomic anotations, cnv analysis and IGV visualisation.

# Spike in
CpG-methylated lambda DNA, 2 kb unmodified spike-in, 144-mer synthetic 5hmC spike-in

# Reference
mm9 for mESCs samples; hg38 for brain samples
